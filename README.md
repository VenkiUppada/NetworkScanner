        Network Scanner
        
        This is a simple network scanner script written in Python using the Scapy library. It allows you to scan a range of IP addresses on your network and retrieve the corresponding MAC addresses of the devices.
        
        Requirements
                Python 3.x
                Scapy library (pip install scapy)
        
        Usage
                Clone the repository or download the network_scanner.py file.
                
                        git clone <repository_url>
                        cd arp_scanner
                
                Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script.
                
                Run the following command to execute the script:
                
                        python network_scanner.py -t [IP_ADDRESS_RANGE]
                
                        Replace [IP_ADDRESS_RANGE] with the range of IP addresses you want to scan. For example: 192.168.0/24.
                
                The script will send ARP requests to the specified IP address range and display the IP addresses and corresponding MAC addresses of the devices that respond.
        
        
        Example
        
                python network_scanner.py -t 192.168.0/24
                Output:
